# SkiCam - Mission

## Objective
Create a mobile application (Flutter) designed specifically for ski coaches, instructors, and serious skiers to record ski videos efficiently on the slopes.

## Core Philosophy
**"Glove-On" Usability**: The entire user experience must be designed to be operable without taking off thick ski gloves.

## Key Features

### 1. Instant Recording via Hardware Button
- **Goal**: Zero friction from pocket to recording.
- **Action**: Immediately launch the app and start recording video.
- **Implementations**:
    - **iPhone 15/16 Pro**: Pressing the **Action Button**.
    - **Android (Samsung)**: Double-pressing the **Side Key** (Configurable in Settings > Advanced features > Side key).
    - **Android (Pixel/Stock)**: Double-pressing the **Power Button** (Requires app to register as a Camera app or use third-party remapping tools).

### 2. Physical Button Zoom Control
- **Volume Up**: Zoom In.
- **Volume Down**: Zoom Out.
- **Rationale**: Touch screens are difficult to use with gloves; physical buttons provide reliable tactile feedback.

## Target Audience
- Ski Coaches
- Ski Instructors
- Serious Skiers analyzing technique
